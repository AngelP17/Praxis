# Phased Roadmap

## Phase 0: Identity & Docs
- Project repositioned as Aether
- Architecture diagrams in Mermaid
- Decision engine concepts documented
- Portfolio positioning defined

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation
- FastAPI app scaffolded
- PostgreSQL models (11 tables)
- Alembic migrations
- Normalized Excel ingest
- Immutable ticket events on import

## Phase 2: Feature Derivation
- Thread cleaner and summary extraction
- Severity, urgency, business impact, SLA features
- Recurrence and actionability signals

## Phase 3: Decision Engine
- Priority scoring policy implemented
- Root cause rule engine
- Decision records persisted
- Ranked recommendations generated

## Phase 4: Retrieval & Clustering
- Similar-case indexing and lookup
- Duplicate detection heuristics
- Incident clustering logic and linkage

## Phase 5: Frontend Command Center
- Next.js app scaffolded
- Ranked queue and ticket case view
- Recommendation stack and confidence meter
- Incident detail and audit timeline
- Replay view and operator feedback

## Phase 6: Reporting
- 5-tab styled Excel workbook
- Charts, conditional formatting, risk bands
- Report export panel in UI

## Phase 7: Hardening
- Immutable audit snapshots
- WebSocket updates
- Decision determinism tests
- Split CI/CD pipelines (api, web, reports)
